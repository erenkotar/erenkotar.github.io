About Me
=====
---
I'm Eren Kotar, an MSc Computer Engineering student at Boğaziçi University in Istanbul, Turkey, and a participant at TABILAB (Text Analytics and BioInformatics Laboratory). I completed my Bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering at Istanbul Technical University.

My current research focuses on open-domain named entity recognition (NER) for Turkish, aiming to build robust, type-flexible models for real-world NLP systems. My broader research interests include natural language processing, machine learning, and data science.
